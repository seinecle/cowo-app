# A replacement for the older cowo version

This the new version of a project (also named cowo) which I had developed in the early 2010s.

Cowo (older version) was one of my first coding projects.
It is very badly written and unmaintanable, this is why I dropped it.
You can find the archived version of this older version [here](https://github.com/seinecle/Cowo).

# What's new

Cowo is meant to be called via an API. It is implemented in [Nocode Functions](https://nocodefunctions.com).
